## What is this?
This web application provides users with the ability to query and fetch geolocation information and other details about an IP address. 
Leveraging the ipinfo.io API, the application provides a user-friendly interface to input an IP address and retrieve its corresponding data, such as city, region, country, and more.

Moreover, this application also generates various communication templates based on the fetched IP details. These templates, suitable for different scenarios such as "Traffic Not Seen", "Traffic Seen + Allowed", and "Known Violator DC", are intended to facilitate streamlined and efficient communication for the users. They can be copied to the clipboard with a simple click.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Additional features of the application include:
Customizable user interface, allowing users to change the background color, switch to dark mode, and adjust font size.
Local storage functionality, allowing user inputs to be stored and retrieved for future visits.
Regular expressions used to validate the format of the input IP address.
All the communication templates have a "Copy to Clipboard" button to facilitate easy sharing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Built with:
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a useful tool for anyone who frequently needs to check IP information and communicate the findings in a standardized and efficient manner

--->>> Please note: the ipinfo.io API requires a token to function properly. The one included in this is a free tier placeholder and may need to be replaced with your own.

<br>Yes. Currently just using Ipinfo.io</br>
